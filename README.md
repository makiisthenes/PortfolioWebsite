`LAMP Stack, PHP, MYSQL` Used in Portfolio.

This was my first time using PHP and MySQL in combination to make a portfolio/blog website, which was a project we had to make for our module `Fundamentals of Web Technology`. 

I would say was one of my most enjoyable modules, I did spent alot of time and went above and beyond in terms of the webpage requirements. I did achieve a `overall 97.2% on this module`.


Extra things I did:

- Implementing email spam protection, by only adding my email to dom elements with Javascript when the user actually hovers over it, stopping spam email scrapers from collecting my email.

- Implemented alot of php form and field validation security fields, stopping users from inputting script tags into forms, etcs.

- Used Adobe XD to iterate through various designs on each webpage of the site, and based css and webpage of the designs created.
